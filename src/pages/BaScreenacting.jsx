                  The B.A. in Screen Acting is a specialized undergraduate
                  program designed exclusively for aspiring actors who wish to
                  build professional careers performing in front of the camera.
                  The program is rooted in the belief that effective screen
                  acting emerges from a deep understanding of filmmaking as a
                  collaborative art form, not from performance training in
                  isolation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the first year, students undergo a strong foundational
                  training in filmmaking, studying alongside B.Sc. in Filmmaking
                  students. During this phase, they learn the basics of
                  direction and screenplay writing, cinematography, film
                  editing, sound recording and design, and VFX & motion
                  graphics. This interdisciplinary foundation enables acting
                  students to understand camera language, shot composition,
                  continuity, sound, and post-production—significantly enhancing
                  their ability to perform with awareness, precision, and
                  creative sensitivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the second year onwards, the program intensifies its
                  focus on screen acting and performance for camera, covering
                  acting methods, script analysis, character development,
                  emotional realism, body language, choreography, movement, and
                  voice modulation. Regular camera-facing exercises and
                  performance shoots help students develop screen presence,
                  on-set discipline, and professional confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A distinctive strength of the program is its integration with
                  filmmaking students, allowing actors to collaborate on real
                  film projects and gain hands-on experience on professional
                  sets. Through supervised productions, workshops, and
                  jury-evaluated performances, the program develops versatile,
                  industry-ready screen actors with a strong foundation in
                  cinematic storytelling—preparing them to work across all
                  platforms where cinema is created and experienced.

                The B.A. in Screen Acting program offers a structured and
                performance-oriented curriculum designed to train actors for
                Film, Television, and OTT platforms. Core training areas include

              </p>
              <p>
                Students will be trained in acting methods tailored for the
                screen, including detailed script analysis, character
                development, and on-camera performance techniques. They will
                also gain valuable insights into the filmmaking process,
                equipping them to collaborate effectively with directors,
                cinematographers, and production teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through workshops, projects, and hands-on shoots, students will
                develop the artistic, technical, and professional competencies
                needed to excel in today’s competitive screen acting industry.
                Evaluation is conducted through jury assessments by industry
                professionals, providing valuable feedback and exposure to
                professional standards. The program fosters emotional
                intelligence, discipline, and screen presence, shaping students
                into versatile and industry- ready performers.

                significantly enhances employability, as actors trained in
                camera language, editing continuity, sound, and direction are
                better equipped to adapt to professional film sets.
