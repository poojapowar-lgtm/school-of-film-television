            <p> Dear Parents and Students,</p>
            <p>
              On behalf of all our faculty & staff, I welcome you all to the
              School of Film & Theatre or as we fondly refer to it as SFT. As
              dean of SFT, I am very proud of the rich tradition that we have
              adopted to impart experiential learning of Film Education.
              Endorsed under the aegis MIT ADT University, our program prepares
              students to become film makers with the ethical depth and
              intellectual intensity essential to meet the challenges of a time
              of critical transition in society.
            </p>

              Generating Ideas is not a problem. But the lack of know how as to
              how to give them shape, is what prevents us from reaching our
              goal. It’s one’s attachment to the baggage that we carry, that
              prevents us from giving fruition to our ideas. Here’s where SFT
              comes into picture.
