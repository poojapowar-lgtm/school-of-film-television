                The MIT ADT University, Rajbaug Campus is not merely an academic
                space, it stands on land deeply rooted in the history of Indian
                cinema. Spread across 125 acres, the campus includes part of
                what was historically known as Rajbaug, the family estate of the
                legendary filmmaker Raj Kapoor.It was on this land that Kapoor
                conceptualised, planned, and created several of his most iconic
                films, including Bobby, Mera Naam Joker, Satyam Shivam Sundaram,
                Prem Rog, and later Prem Granth. Renowned filmmaker Yash Chopra
                also filmed portions of Kala Patthar here, further cementing
                Rajbaug’s place in India’s cinematic heritage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Raj Kapoor’s association with this land was deeply personal and
                creative. In keeping with his vision, the Kapoor family chose to
                dedicate this space to education and creative pursuit, ensuring
                that it would serve a noble purpose rather than commercial
                development. Honouring this legacy, MIT ADT University has
                preserved Raj Kapoor’s bungalow and established a dedicated Raj
                Kapoor Memorial and Museum on campus. The University also houses
                the samadhis of Raj Kapoor and his parents, making Rajbaug a
                site of cultural reverence and a living monument to Indian
                cinema.

            The family bungalow on the estate, preserved by the University, is
            noted as the location where the iconic song “Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein
            Band Ho” was filmed, further reinforcing the connection between
            Kapoor’s creative work and the land that now houses the film school.
            This historical association significantly enhances the cultural
            heritage value of the campus where the MIT School of Film &
            Television educates future filmmakers. Building upon this
            extraordinary legacy, the MIT School of Film & Television (MITSFT)
            functions under the mentorship of legendary filmmaker and multiple
            National Award winner Dr. Jabbar Patel. Under his guidance, the
            School integrates cinematic tradition with contemporary,
            internationally benchmarked filmmaking practices. Students are
            trained not only in technical and creative skills but are also
            immersed in cinema as an art form, a cultural expression, and a
            professional discipline. Together, the enduring legacy of Raj Kapoor
            and the visionary mentorship of Dr. Jabbar Patel shape the MIT
            School of Film & Television as a unique institution—where the next
            generation of filmmakers and screen performers is educated in the
            true spirit of cinema, on land where Indian film history itself was
            created.
